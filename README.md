## Event Playlist Mobile APP

The main idea of our project is to create mobile app in which costumers will have possibility to create event (public or private) and in event costumers will search and add 
songs. After that they will have possibility to put likes and the best songs will be in TOP. DJ of the party will know what music people like in this event.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lidijasimoliunaite/Labas/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
